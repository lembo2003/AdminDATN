## Implementation Status Legend
- ‚úÖ Complete
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚è≥ Not Started

## Next Steps

Following the fix for the Firebase configuration, your priorities should be:

1. **Implement Room Type Management**: This is fundamental as rooms depend on room types
2. **Complete Room Management**: Finish the room addition functionality
3. **Finish the Booking System**: Complete the admin views for bookings
4. **Implement Order System**: Complete the user-facing views for orders

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

1. **Firebase Configuration**: The configuration has been updated to work with Firebase v9 SDK. Make sure all files importing Firebase are compatible with this version.

2. **File Upload Handling**: The system uses local file storage instead of Firebase Storage. Ensure all upload directories have proper permissions.

3. **QR Code Integration**: The HTML5 QR code scanner requires camera access. Ensure proper permissions and HTTPS in production.

## Testing Guidelines

As you implement each phase:

1. Test authentication flows thoroughly
2. Verify that admin-only routes are properly protected
3. Test file uploads with various image sizes and formats
4. Verify that booking dates are properly validated
5. Test the QR code generation and scanning functionality
6. Ensure proper error handling for all user inputs
