# Development Session Guide

This guide explains how to continue development in future chat sessions. Follow these instructions to seamlessly pick up development where you left off.

## Starting a New Development Session

When starting a new chat session to continue development, provide the following context:

1. Reference this project and its current state
2. Mention which component you want to work on
3. Share relevant files if needed for context

## Example Prompt for a New Session

Here's an example of how to start a new session:

```
I'm continuing development on the Hotel Management System project. 
Currently, I'm working on implementing the Room Type management functionality.

Here are the relevant files for context:
1. models/roomType.js - The existing Room Type model
2. routes/admin.js - Admin routes file that needs to be updated
3. controllers/adminController.js - Contains some room management code

Can you help me create the roomTypeController.js file and the necessary views?
```

## Files to Share for Different Tasks

Depending on the component you're working on, you may need to share different files for context:

### Room Type Management
- models/roomType.js
- controllers/adminController.js (partial)
- views/admin/rooms/index.ejs (for reference)

### Room Management Completion
- models/room.js
- controllers/roomController.js
- views/admin/rooms/edit.ejs

### Booking Management
- models/booking.js
- controllers/bookingController.js
- views/booking/confirmation.ejs

### Order System
- models/order.js
- models/orderItem.js
- controllers/orderController.js

### User Profile
- models/user.js
- controllers/userController.js
- views/user/profile.ejs

## Addressing Bugs or Errors

If you encounter a bug or error, provide:

1. The error message
2. The file where the error occurs
3. The context around the error
4. Any steps to reproduce the error

Example:
```
I'm getting this error when trying to add a room:
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'filename' of undefined"

It happens in the roomController.js file, in the postAddRoom function.
Here's the relevant code from the controller:
[paste code]

I'm submitting a form with an image upload.
```

## Implementing New Features

When implementing a new feature, share:

1. Which feature you want to implement
2. Related existing files for context
3. Any specific requirements or designs

## Continuing Implementation Progress

1. Regularly check the UPDATED_ROADMAP.md to see what needs to be implemented next
2. Mark items as completed when they're done
3. Update the PROJECT_CONTEXT.md when significant progress is made

## Getting Help with Specific Components

### Firebase Integration Issues
If you have Firebase integration issues, share:
- config/firebase.js
- The specific error message
- Whether you've confirmed your service_account.json file is properly set up

- middleware/fileUpload.js

## Testing Your Implementation

When testing:

1. Describe what you're testing
2. Share relevant code if needed
3. Describe expected vs actual behavior
4. Share any error messages

## Deployment Questions

For deployment questions, provide:
- Your target deployment platform
- Any specific concerns or requirements
- Current project structure or configurations relevant to deployment
