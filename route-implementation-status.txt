## Route Files To Create

For each set of routes, you need to create the corresponding route file:

1. **User Routes** - Create `routes/user.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require('../controllers/userController');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

router.get('/profile', auth, userController.getProfile);
router.post('/profile', auth, userController.updateProfile);
router.get('/dashboard', auth, userController.getDashboard);
// Add more routes as needed

module.exports = router;
```

2. **Room Routes** - Create `routes/room.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const roomController = require('../controllers/roomController');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

router.get('/', roomController.getRooms);
router.get('/:roomId', roomController.getRoomDetails);
// Add more routes as needed

module.exports = router;
```

3. **Booking Routes** - Create `routes/booking.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const bookingController = require('../controllers/bookingController');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

router.get('/create/:roomId', auth, bookingController.getBookingForm);
router.post('/create/:roomId', auth, bookingController.createBooking);
router.get('/confirmation/:bookingId', auth, bookingController.getBookingConfirmation);
router.get('/my-bookings', auth, bookingController.getMyBookings);
// Add more routes as needed

module.exports = router;
```

4. **Admin Routes** - Create `routes/admin.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const adminController = require('../controllers/adminController');
const isAdmin = require('../middleware/isAdmin');

router.use(isAdmin); // Apply admin middleware to all routes

router.get('/dashboard', adminController.getDashboard);
router.get('/rooms', adminController.getRooms);
// Add more routes as needed

module.exports = router;
```

5. **Order Routes** - Create `routes/order.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const orderController = require('../controllers/orderController');
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

router.get('/menu', orderController.getMenu);
// Add more routes as needed

module.exports = router;
```

## Next Steps

1. Focus on implementing the most important routes first:
   - User profile
   - Room listing and details
   - Admin dashboard

2. For each route you implement:
   - Create the route file if it doesn't exist
   - Implement the controller functions
   - Make sure the views are in place
   - Test the route functionality

3. Update this document as you complete each route
